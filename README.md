# An SMTP server for go
For now this is a small project of mine. I noticed a few smtp server packages, but no clear great ones. I decided to try to make my own (though for now it isn't any better then the current options), mostly so I can learn more about programming in Go and the SMTP protocol (which it turn out is somewhat complicated). Please feel free to use if you think it can help in your project, or send me a pull request or issue which I will review for the time being.

I'd love to have a truly great smtp package for Go, whether or not it's mine. I want it to be modular, and as much go-like as possible. It just seems like the perfect language for this type of application.
